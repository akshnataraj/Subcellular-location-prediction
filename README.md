# Subcellular-location-prediction
## Motivation: 
The recent advances in technology and genome sequencing, has resulted in large availability of sequence
data and complete sequence has been determined for over 3000 genomes. As a consequence, the need for automated
and efficient methods for analyzing huge amounts of data is evident. Finding homology in the function of proteins is a
difficult task and a close approximation is to find the subcellular location of a protein and mapping its function. In this
paper, different machine learning algorithms have been experimented and results are discussed.

## Results: 
Ensemble methods performed the best compared to clustering, non-linear classifiers. Results emphasize the
Gradient Boosting classifier is able to effectively classify with a test accuracy of 66.7%.
